<h1 id="blue">Who's Scamper?</h1>
<p>
Scamper is the blood, sweat and tears of six dedicated final year Bachelor of Information Technology students at Queensland University of Technology. Left 
entirely to their own devices for this final year capstone project, Scamper grew from a rudimentary basic prototype to this beta release you see now. The development
team is very fortunate to have the support of Mr Andrew Marrington (their very cool project supervisor), and excellent advice from Ms Stieler (of Education Queensland).
